# Ryntel's website
Website to present the Ryntel team, realized by Hisakiyo with Django Framework.

# Origins
Originally, we helped people who asked for help on the channel #aide_informatique of the [Sardoche's Discord](https://discord.gg/sardoche)


And then it became a team in its own right, with a dedicated discord.
